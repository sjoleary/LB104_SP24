# Ecological Succession {#sec-ecological-succession}

the thord prelab needs to be changed to HW to prep for the last week; it's currently in quiz format, I should switch it to single document that they submit for easier grading

After completing this unit, you should be able to

For each of our units we will have a project folder[^c_ecological-succession-1] with an `Rproject`, `*.qmd`-files to complete lab assignments and write your lab report along with sub-directories to hold the data and results that you will generate. At the beginning of the semester, you should have created a directory on your Desktop or Documents folder on your laptop and named it something like `bi104` as a home directory for all of our project folders this semester.

[^c_ecological-succession-1]: We will use "directory" and "folder" synonymously throughout this lab handbook

Download the 03_Succession project folder. Once you have downloaded it, unzip the project directory into your `bi104` directory[^c_ecological-succession-2].

[^c_ecological-succession-2]: On a MacOS, your system it will automatically unzip the folder for you and you should be able to directly move the **entire unzipped directory** to your `bi104` folder. On a Windows OS you will need to right click and select `extract all`, then you should be able to specify which directory you want to unzip your file into.

Once you have done this, you can open the `Rproj` for this module either by double clicking on it which will launch `Rstudio` or by opening `Rstudio` and then using `File > Open Project` or by clicking on the `Rproject` icon in the top right of your program window and selecting `Open Project`.

Once you have opened a project you should see the project name in the top right corner[^c_ecological-succession-3].

[^c_ecological-succession-3]: Pro tip: If you run into issues where a `quarto` document won't render or file paths aren't working (especially if things were working previously) one of your first steps should be to double check that the correct `Rproj` is loaded.
