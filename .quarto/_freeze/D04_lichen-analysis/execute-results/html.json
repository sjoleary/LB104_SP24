As such we will have you working directly in your lab report to analyze your data and describe your results. Before you go today, make sure you can render your report to a word document that will contain all your figures and tables that you will then be able to use to complete your lab report.\n\nTake some notes during class room discussions for you to be able to use when you finalize your introduction, methods, results, and discussion section and turn in your report.\n:::\n\nBefore you get started you will need to download your data set from our shared drive. As usual, go to the `GoogleSheet`, select `File` -> `Download` and then `Tab Seperated Values (tsv)`. Then rename the file to `lichen-survey.tsv` and move to your `data` folder in your current project folder.\n\nIn the next section we will generate a sample map that you should include in your methods section of your report. You can download the file from the `results` files on the google drive and move it into your current `Rproject` folder, and then insert in your methods section in the `Study Area/Site Description` section.\n\n## Data Exploration\n\n### Explore sample locations (micro-habitats)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nlichen <- read_delim(\"data/lichen-survey.tsv\") %>%\n  clean_names() %>%\n  mutate(tree_density = ordered(tree_density,\n                                levels = c(\"free-standing\", \n                                           \"small-group\", \n                                           \"continuous-forest\")))\n\n# get lat/long for plot boundaries\nmin_lat <- min(lichen$latitude, na.rm = TRUE)\nmax_lat <- max(lichen$latitude, na.rm = TRUE)\n\nmin_long <- min(lichen$longitude, na.rm = TRUE)\nmax_long <- max(lichen$longitude, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# pull major street features\nbig_streets <- opq(bbox = c(min_long-0.0025, min_lat-0.0025, \n                            max_long+0.0025, max_lat+0.0025),\n                   memsize = 2e9) %>%\n  add_osm_feature(key = \"highway\", \n                  value = c(\"motorway\", \"primary\", \"motorway_link\", \"primary_link\")) %>%\n  osmdata_sf()\n\n# pull medium sized streets\nmed_streets <- opq(bbox = c(min_long-0.0025, min_lat-0.0025, \n                            max_long+0.0025, max_lat+0.0025),\n                   memsize = 2e9) %>%\n  add_osm_feature(key = \"highway\", \n                  value = c(\"secondary\", \"tertiary\", \"secondary_link\", \"tertiary_link\")) %>%\n  osmdata_sf()\n\n# pull small streets\nsmall_streets <- opq(bbox = c(min_long-0.0025, min_lat-0.0025, \n                              max_long+0.0025, max_lat+0.0025),\n                   memsize = 2e9) %>%\n  add_osm_feature(key = \"highway\", \n                  value = c(\"residential\", \"living_street\",\n                            \"unclassified\",\n                            \"service\", \"footway\")) %>%\n  osmdata_sf()\n\n# pull rivers\nrivers <- opq(bbox = c(min_long-0.0025, min_lat-0.0025, \n                       max_long+0.0025, max_lat+0.0025),\n                   memsize = 2e9) %>%\n  add_osm_feature(key = \"waterway\", value = \"river\") %>%\n  osmdata_sf()\n\n# pull railways\nrailway <- opq(bbox = c(min_long-0.0025, min_lat-0.0025, \n                        max_long+0.0025, max_lat+0.0025),\n                   memsize = 2e9) %>%\n  add_osm_feature(key = \"railway\", value=\"rail\") %>%\n  osmdata_sf()\n\n# compile plot\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = rivers$osm_lines,\n          inherit.aes = FALSE,\n          color = \"steelblue\",\n          size = .8,\n          alpha = .3) +\n  geom_sf(data = railway$osm_lines,\n          inherit.aes = FALSE,\n          color = \"black\",\n          size = .2,\n          linetype=\"dotdash\",\n          alpha = .5) +\n  geom_sf(data = med_streets$osm_lines,\n          inherit.aes = FALSE,\n          color = \"black\",\n          size = 1.5,\n          alpha = 1) +\n  geom_sf(data = small_streets$osm_lines,\n          inherit.aes = FALSE,\n          color = \"black\",\n          size = 1,\n          alpha = 1) +\n  geom_sf(data = big_streets$osm_lines,\n          inherit.aes = FALSE,\n          color = \"black\",\n          size = 2,\n          alpha = 1) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(min_long-0.0025, max_long+0.0025), \n           ylim = c(min_lat-0.001, max_lat+0.001),\n           expand = FALSE) +\n  geom_point(data = lichen, \n             aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, color = sample_location), \n             size = 1.5, alpha = 1) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = col_loc) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\nggsave(\"results/map_sample-locations.jpg\", dpi = 300)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Sample Area Saint Anselm Campus Lichen survey.

For many of the question you are interested in the differences in those locations are relevant because they differ in the type of habitat, distance to streets, amount of traffic (cars, people), type of trees, tree density, amount of buildings etc. Think about how the differences in sample location might be important for the hypotheses that you are interested in thinking about and take a few notes to include in your study design section.\n\nCompleting a comprehensive survey across campus both allows us to look at differences at a microhabitat level (differences among locations on campus) as well as look at some broad-scale patterns to determine if they are significant across a range of conditions - i.e. it allows us to account for confounding variables.\n\nRemember to describe the different sample locations in your lab report.\n\n*Note: if you are interested in patterns like the effect of tree size on lichen coverage then the fact that you sampled across a range of different types of locations might be an important component because you can eliminate confounding factors that might have played a role in just one location.*\n\n:::\n\nLet's look at our data and see how some of our explanatory variables vary across campus. We'll start with our categorical variables.\n\nInstead of measuring sunlight directly or canopy coverage, we have classified trees as being free-standing, in small groups, or in forested area where a continuous canopy is likely:\n\n\n::: {#tbl-summary-table-tree-density .cell tbl-cap='Tree density in each sample location.'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# MODIFY THIS SECTION ----\n\n# specify column name to group data & calculate descriptive stats\ncol_grp <- \"sample_location\"\n\n# specify  column that contains data to summarize (response variable)\ncol_explanatory <- \"tree_density\"\n\n# DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS BELOW HERE ----\n\n# calculate summary stats for continuous variable\nlichen %>%\n  group_by(!!sym(col_grp)) %>%\n  count(!!sym(col_explanatory)) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"sample_location\",\n              values_from = \"n\") %>%\n  kable()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|tree_density      |  A|  B|  C|  D|  E|  F|\n|:-----------------|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|free-standing     | 11| NA|  4|  3|  2| 15|\n|small-group       |  8| NA|  6|  7|  7|  8|\n|continuous-forest | 16| 25| 15| 32| 21|  1|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can also re-plot our map color coded by tree-density to get some insight into how these areas differ in terms of habitat.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# compile plot\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = rivers$osm_lines,\n          inherit.aes = FALSE,\n          color = \"steelblue\",\n          size = .8,\n          alpha = .3) +\n  geom_sf(data = railway$osm_lines,\n          inherit.aes = FALSE,\n          color = \"black\",\n          size = .2,\n          linetype=\"dotdash\",\n          alpha = .5) +\n  geom_sf(data = med_streets$osm_lines,\n          inherit.aes = FALSE,\n          color = \"black\",\n          size = 1.5,\n          alpha = 1) +\n  geom_sf(data = small_streets$osm_lines,\n          inherit.aes = FALSE,\n          color = \"black\",\n          size = 1,\n          alpha = 1) +\n  geom_sf(data = big_streets$osm_lines,\n          inherit.aes = FALSE,\n          color = \"black\",\n          size = 2,\n          alpha = 1) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(min_long-0.0025, max_long+0.0025), \n           ylim = c(min_lat-0.001, max_lat+0.001),\n           expand = FALSE) +\n  geom_point(data = lichen, \n             aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, color = tree_density), \n             size = 1.5, alpha = 1) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = col_tree_density) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\nggsave(\"results/map_tree-density.jpg\", dpi = 300)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Sample Area Saint Anselm Campus Lichen survey.

This could include both factors such as the amount of available sunlight, differences in evaporation/moisture of the tree as well as the fact that some of our sample locations differ in terms of the vicinity to buildings that could have additional effects in terms of impacting the amout of sun and how affected trees are by wind and other weather effects.\n\nFirst, we will want to look at differences in central tendency and variability of coverage for different aspects of the tree.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-coverage-north-I .cell tbl-cap='Descriptive statistics of lichen coverage on the north side of the tree.'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# MODIFY THIS SECTION ----\n\n# specify column name to group data & calculate descriptive stats\ncol_grp <- \"site\"\n\n# specify  column that contains data to summarize (response variable)\ncol_response <- \"coverage_north\"\n\n# DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS BELOW HERE ----\n\n# calculate summary stats for continuous variable\nlichen %>%\n  group_by(!!sym(col_grp)) %>%\n  summarize(mean = mean(!!sym(col_response), na.rm = TRUE),\n            sd = sd(!!sym(col_response), na.rm = TRUE),\n            min = min(!!sym(col_response), na.rm = TRUE),\n            max = max(!!sym(col_response), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  kable()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|site |     mean|      sd| min| max|\n|:----|--------:|-------:|---:|---:|\n|SAC  | 17.98343| 23.3513|   0|  90|\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-coverage-east-I .cell tbl-cap='Descriptive statistics of lichen coverage on the east side of the tree.'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# MODIFY THIS SECTION ----\n\n# specify column name to group data & calculate descriptive stats\ncol_grp <- \"site\"\n\n# specify  column that contains data to summarize (response variable)\ncol_response <- \"coverage_east\"\n\n# DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS BELOW HERE ----\n\n# calculate summary stats for continuous variable\nlichen %>%\n  group_by(!!sym(col_grp)) %>%\n  summarize(mean = mean(!!sym(col_response), na.rm = TRUE),\n            sd = sd(!!sym(col_response), na.rm = TRUE),\n            min = min(!!sym(col_response), na.rm = TRUE),\n            max = max(!!sym(col_response), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  kable()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|site |    mean|       sd| min| max|\n|:----|-------:|--------:|---:|---:|\n|SAC  | 16.8453| 23.60128|   0| 100|\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-coverage-south-I .cell tbl-cap='Descriptive statistics of lichen coverage on the south side of the tree.'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# MODIFY THIS SECTION ----\n\n# specify column name to group data & calculate descriptive stats\ncol_grp <- \"site\"\n\n# specify  column that contains data to summarize (response variable)\ncol_response <- \"coverage_south\"\n\n# DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS BELOW HERE ----\n\n# calculate summary stats for continuous variable\nlichen %>%\n  group_by(!!sym(col_grp)) %>%\n  summarize(mean = mean(!!sym(col_response), na.rm = TRUE),\n            sd = sd(!!sym(col_response), na.rm = TRUE),\n            min = min(!!sym(col_response), na.rm = TRUE),\n            max = max(!!sym(col_response), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  kable()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|site |     mean|       sd| min| max|\n|:----|--------:|--------:|---:|---:|\n|SAC  | 15.24862| 22.89588|   0| 100|\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-coverage-west-II .cell tbl-cap='Descriptive statistics of lichen coverage on the west side of the tree.'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# MODIFY THIS SECTION ----\n\n# specify column name to group data & calculate descriptive stats\ncol_grp <- \"site\"\n\n# specify  column that contains data to summarize (response variable)\ncol_response <- \"coverage_west\"\n\n# DO NOT MAKE MODIFICATIONS BELOW HERE ----\n\n# calculate summary stats for continuous variable\nlichen %>%\n  group_by(!!sym(col_grp)) %>%\n  summarize(mean = mean(!!sym(col_response), na.rm = TRUE),\n            sd = sd(!!sym(col_response), na.rm = TRUE),\n            min = min(!!sym(col_response), na.rm = TRUE),\n            max = max(!!sym(col_response), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  kable()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|site |     mean|       sd| min| max|\n|:----|--------:|--------:|---:|---:|\n|SAC  | 14.29282| 22.55037|   0| 100|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo compare differences in coverage depending on the side of the tree we have to do a little bit of manipulation of the data frame^[Shamefully, our dataset is not completely tidy - e.g coverage_west is not a variable, it should really be separate columns one for the direction/side of the tree and a second for the coverage.

The water content of lichens is determined by their surrounding environment: lichens lose water, dry up, and become dormant during dry periods, and re-hydrate and become photosynthetically active when moisture is available.\n-   **Air.** Not only do lichens absorb water from surrounding air, lichens also absorb nutrients and pollutants. As a results, they are sensitive to many air-borne pollutants, and the presence and abundance of some species of lichen are reduced in areas high in atmospheric pollution. For example, sulfur dioxide (SO2) combines with moisture in the atmosphere to form sulfurous acid (H2SO3) or sulfuric acid (H2SO4). High levels of SO2 pollution are associated with decreased lichen respiration and photosynthesis, deactivation of enzymes resulting in reduced metabolic activity and reduced membrane integrity.\n-   **Nutrients.** Nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, carbon, oxygen) are needed for cellular processes that support lichen growth and survival. Lichens obtain their nutrients from air and water, and, to a lesser extent, their substrate.\n-   **Light.** Lichens are able to fix energy and carbon using photosynthesis and, thus, they require light + carbon dioxide + water.\n-   **Substrate.** Lichens require a substrate to attach to, and can be found on both natural (e.g., trees, rocks, soil) and artificial substrates (e.g., tombstones, buildings, abandoned equipment). Furthermore, characteristics of the substrate can influence how lichens interact with other aspects of their habitat. For example, substrate pH (e.g., limestone, tree bark with high (basic) pH) can counteract the acidity of SO2 pollution, so that in high pollution areas lichens may be found only on sites with high (basics) pH.\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Consider this\"}\n\nWith the exception of substrate type (tree type), we did not measure any of those requirements directly. Therefore, it is important for us to consider how the variables that we did measure relate to those requirements and how we can better understand how the presence, abundance, and distribution of lichen.\n\nThink about how the parameters that you have measured related to these four categories. You will want to use this information both to formulate your research question and also when you interpret your results.\n\n:::\n",
