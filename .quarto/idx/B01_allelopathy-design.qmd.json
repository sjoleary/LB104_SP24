Bioassays typically have a simple, easily repeatable design as you want to be able to assess your results within a few weeks.\n\n[^06_allelopathy-design-2]: A **bioassay** is an experiment designed to determine the properties and effects of a drug or chemical on the bodies of living organisms by testing it under controlled laboratory conditions.\n\nWe will be using radish seeds to test effects, their seeds have sufficient nutrients to allow them to grow on their own without photosynthesizing for at least a week. We will be placing our bioassays in a cool, dark area to grow.\n\nMake sure you take a look at the materials that are available to you and consider how you might incorporate them into your design. Be as specific as possible to describe how you will run your experiment. Make sure you are taking detailed notes on your design in the GoogleDoc provided to you and be ready to discuss why you have made specific choices.\n\nFinalize your design after a discussion on key concepts on experimental design. Make sure you complete the experimental design cheat sheet and submit it on Canvas.\n\n## Homework\n\nComplete the posted discussion questions and submit them on Canvas.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":false,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","reference-location":"margin","toc":true,"toc-depth":2,"number-sections":true,"embed-resources":true,"output-file":"B01_allelopathy-design.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
