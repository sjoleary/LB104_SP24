After completing this component you will use the provided template to write a lab report. You should refer to your methods and this analysis `quarto` documents to complete your methods and results sections. You will be able to pull your analysis section directly from this document[^08_allelopathy-analysis-1] to produce the tables and/or figures you want to include in your report. Typically for your methods you would have sections describing your experimental design and data collection and how you did your analysis. You should make sure that you understand what we are doing here and why to describe each step in your report and then include the code to make that happen.\n\n[^08_allelopathy-analysis-1]: cut and paste is your friend!\n\nIn your results section, refer to your figures/tables that you include as you describe your results. From this and previous chapters, remember that you can use the `label` code chunk option to give your code chunk a name, for code chunks that produce a figure if you preface that name with `fig` it will automatically number your figures for you. Similarly, if it is a code chunk that produces a table, if you preface your label name with `tbl` it will automatically number your tables. You should use the `fig-cap` and `tbl-cap` code chunk options to include a figure/table caption. So for example if you are producing a bar plot for frequencies you could use `#| label: fig-bar` and then `#| fig-cap: \"Descriptive  figure caption` to get a number figure in your report.\n\nLet's load our `R` packages and get rolling!\n\n```{r}\n#| label: setup\n#| include: false\n\n# load libraries for reporting\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n# load libraries for data import\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\n# load libraries for data wrangling\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(tibble)\n\n# load libraries for plotting\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\n# load library for stats\nlibrary(infer)\n\n# load dataset\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\n```\n\n## Germination frequency\n\n### Get the data\n\nGo to the `GoogleSheet` that contains the germination counts for your lab and select the tab for your group. Double check that the data has been entered correctly. Then go to `File` -\\> `Download` -\\> `Tab Separated Values (.tsv)` down load your data as a tab-delimited file. Now, use your `File Explorer` if you are on a Windows computer and `Finder` of you are on a Mac and navigate to the `Downloads` folder. You should see the file you just downloaded there. Rename it to `gemination_plant.tsv` depending on the plant you are testing and place it in the `data` folder of your `02_Allelopathy` project folder.\n\nOnce you go back to your `Rstudio` window with your `Rproj` loaded you should see the file in your `data` folder in the `Files` pane. Double check that it is there, if not, as you instructor to help you get set up.\n\nNow we are ready to read in our germination data as a `data.frame` that we can compute on in `R`.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: read-germination-data\n\n# define your filename\nfile <- \"germination_demo-1.tsv\" # CHANGE THIS TO YOUR EXACT FILENAME, remember R is case sensitive\n\n# read in data\ngermination <- read_delim(here(\"data\", file), delim = \"\\t\") %>%\n  clean_names()\n\n# take a look at first few lines\nhead(germination)\n\n```\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Consider this\"}\nTake a look at the `data.frame` object holding your data by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane (bottom left) or using `View(germination)`.\n\nDescribe how your data is organized:\n\n-   what information is in each row?\n-   what information is in each column?\n\nAssess what type of data you have\n\n-   is it continuous or categorical?\n-   what groups are you comparing?\n\nThen determine which descriptive statistics are appropriate to summarize this data set and how you would visualize your data.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Answer\" collapse=\"true\"}\nEach row represents one seed.

In either case you would include a descriptive figure or table title/caption that describes how to interpret the figure[^08_allelopathy-analysis-2].\n\nThen you describe your results referencing your figure/table, however, your reader should be able to have the full picture of your results even without seeing the actual figure/table. A good template to use is to start with the broad pattern and then highlight important details. A good description of results contextualizes them for the reader[^08_allelopathy-analysis-3]. You have already done all the thinking, guide your reader through what you've found.\n\nDescribe your results[^08_allelopathy-analysis-4]. Remember, at this point you should not be interpreting them.\n:::\n\n[^08_allelopathy-analysis-2]: As a rule of thumb, you should have enough information in the caption that the reader can understand the figure even without reading the methods/results\n\n[^08_allelopathy-analysis-3]: For example, instead of just listing out values provide context and help your reader see the patterns by using terms like \"higher\" \"lower\", \"similar\" or highlighting certain results as \"notably, ...\", \"except for...\".\n\n[^08_allelopathy-analysis-4]: Consider this thinking out loud in a way where you have a set of notes that you can then edit for your report.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Answer\" collapse=\"true\"}\nYour description could look something like this:\n\nBroad pattern:\n\n> Radish seeds exposed to plant had a 22% lower germination success compared to the control.\n\nDetails\n\n> Overall, a total of 39 seeds (65%) germinated in the control, while only 26 (43%) germinated in the experimental treatment (Figure xx).\n\nIt's important that we add this context because it is quite different if 100% germinated in the control and 78% in the experimental treatment or something more similar to what we observe here.\n:::\n\nDescriptive statistics are the important first step to summarizing our findings.

Overall, a total of 39 seeds (65%) germinated in the control, while only 26 (43%) germinated in the experimental treatment (Figure xx). This difference is statistically significant (p = 0.02).\n\nIn the discussion we would interpret our results:\n\n> The germination rate of radish seeds was significantly lower when they were exposed to plant X (Figure X). This is consistent with our hypothesis that plant X is releasing an allelopathic chemical compound which impacts radish seed germination.\n:::\n\nRemember, if your results are not statistically significant, you still need to write a set of conclusions! Even though we seem to think that \"negative results\" are \"bad\", \"negative\" just means that we did not observe an effect - but that is also a result because you can now exclude one possible explanation for your observation and move on to test the next one.\n\n## Seedling growth\n\n### Get your data\n\nGo to the `GoogleSheet` that contains the seedling lengths for your lab and select the tab for your group.

It could also be helpful to generate additional summary statistics including median, minimum and maximum values to give yourself an overview of the data.\n\nWe can explore to visualizations for your data, the first is that you can visualize the distributions using a histogram, the second is that you can visualize the mean and standard deviation using a bar chart or similar.\n:::\n\nWe will need to summarize our results to evaluate our findings.\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Consider this\"}\nSuggest 3-4 metrics to summarize your data in a meaningful way that will allow you to describe your results in the context of the hypothesis you are exploring with this experiment.\n\nExplain why you think these would be appropriate data analysis methods.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Answer\" collapse=\"true\"}\nAs we have continuous data, we can use the descriptive statistics we have discussed previously that allow us to assess the distribution (histogram), central tendency (mean, median, mode) and variability (variance, standard deviation) of our data.\n:::\n\nLet's start by putting together a table with summary statistics.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-summary-length\n#| tbl-cap: \"Summary statistics for seedling length.

Make sure that you are being specific and adding context to make it easy for your reader to identify the key patterns.\n\nAs rule of thumb, you should describe your results so that your reader has all the key information they need even without seeing the data tables.\n\nRemember, at this point you should not be interpreting your results!\n:::\n\n[^08_allelopathy-analysis-6]: Consider this thinking out loud in a way where you have a set of notes that you can then edit for your report.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Answer\" collapse=\"true\"}\nYour description could look something like this:\n\nBroad pattern:\n\n> Overall, seedling growth was lower for radish seeds exposed to plant X compared to the control.\n\nDetails\n\n> Mean seedling growth after 1 week was 6.2 +/- 1.7mm for plants exposed to plant X compared to a mean length of 8.4 +/- 1.47mm in the control. Similarly, the variability in seedling length was higher in exposed radish seeds (range = 3 - 10) compared to the control (range = 5 - 11).\n\nIn this case, you would not need to include table because you've included all the values, rather you might chose to include figure that effectively summarizes your data that you would then reference here.\n:::\n\nAgain, data visualizations are an important tool to summarize and present your data. Let's start by visualizing our data with a histogram which emphasize the distribution of our values.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-length-histogram\n#| fig-cap: \"Seedling length distribution after 1 week for radish seeds explosed to plant X (green) and not (orange).\" \n\nggplot(length, aes(x = length_mm, fill = treatment)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1,\n                 color = \"black\") +\n  facet_grid(treatment ~ .) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = colors) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n```\n\nAlternatively, we could create a bar plot where the height is scaled relative to the mean. This also allows us to add error bars that are scaled to the length of the standard deviation[^08_allelopathy-analysis-7].\n\n[^08_allelopathy-analysis-7]: This is a classic plot for experiments with multiple treatments\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-length-bar\n#| fig-cap: \"Mean seedling length and standard deviation after 1 week for radish seeds explosed to plant X (green) and not (orange).\"\n\n# create dataframe with mean and sd\nsummary <- length %>%\n  group_by(treatment) %>%\n  summarise(mean = mean(length_mm),\n            sd = sd(length_mm))\n\nggplot(summary) +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = treatment, y = mean,\n               fill = treatment),\n           stat = \"identity\",\n           color = \"black\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(x = treatment,\n                    ymin = mean-sd,\n                    ymax = mean+sd),\n                width = 0.25,\n                size = 1.2) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = colors) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n```\n\nBar plots take up a lot of \"ink\" and so an alternative is to create a plot using a point range. In that case the mean is represented by a point and the standard deviation by lines extending out from that point.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-length-point\n#| fig-cap: \"Mean seedling length and standard deviation after 1 week for radish seeds explosed to plant X (green) and not (orange).\"\n\n# create dataframe with mean and sd\nsummary <- length %>%\n  group_by(treatment) %>%\n  summarise(mean = mean(length_mm),\n            sd = sd(length_mm))\n\n# create dataframe with mean and sd\nsummary <- length %>%\n  group_by(treatment) %>%\n  summarise(mean = mean(length_mm),\n            sd = sd(length_mm))\n\nggplot(summary) +\n  geom_pointrange(aes(x = treatment,\n                    y = mean,\n                    ymin = mean-sd,\n                    ymax = mean+sd,\n                    color = treatment),\n                size = 1.2) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = colors) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n```\n\nAgain, our set of summary statistics and data visualization enable us to present the patterns in our data set.

Mean seedling growth after 1 week was 6.2 +/- 1.7mm for plants exposed to plant X compared to a mean length of 8.4 +/- 1.47mm in the control. Similarly, the variability in seedling length was higher in exposed radish seeds (range = 3 - 10) compared to the control (range = 5 - 11).\n\nIn the discussion we would interpret our results:\n\n> The growth rate of radish seeds was significantly lower when they were exposed to plant X (Figure X). This is consistent with our hypothesis that plant X is releasing an allelopathic chemical compound which impacts radish seed growth.\n:::\n\nRemember, if your results are not statistically significant, you still need to write a set of conclusions! Even though we seem to think that \"negative results\" are \"bad\", \"negative\" just means that we did not observe an effect - but that is also a result because you can now exclude one possible explanation for your observation and move on to test the next one.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":false,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","reference-location":"margin","toc":true,"toc-depth":2,"number-sections":true,"embed-resources":true,"output-file":"B03_allelopathy-analysis.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
